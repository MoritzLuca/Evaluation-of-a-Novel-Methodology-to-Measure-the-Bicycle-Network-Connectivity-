#Abstract: Bicycling is among the most environmentally sustainable and economically affordable modes available. The popularity of bicycling activities strongly depends on the availability of well-connected bicycle networks.  Existing methodologies to measure network connectivity are often purely academic, complex, subjective, or locally specific. This study aims to develop and test a reliable methodology for evaluating bicycle network connectivity. The study proposed two weighted shortest path graph algorithms: low-stress network connectivity (LSNC), and bicycle network connectivity (BNC) algorithms. The weights of the algorithms were the function of slope, level of traffic stress, and link length. We tested the algorithms on the cities of San Francisco, Davis, Sacramento, and Hayward, along with Bay Area counties, using open street map (OSM) data and found that algorithms can produce meaningful quantitative connectivity scores. The developed tool will help planners, engineers, and policymakers with the ability to efficiently evaluate bicycle network connectivity.
#Practical Applications: In general, agencies must understand their network connectivity level before deciding the budget allocation for any infrastructure improvement. This study proposed two novel algorithms that can measure the bike or low-stress network connectivity for biking. The algorithm used the level of traffic stress, slope, and segment length to calculate the connectivity score. The practitioner can apply our proposed algorithm to obtain the connectivity score at a census tract level as well as for the entire network. The connectivity score will range from zero to one, where zero means the network is not connected at all, and one means the network is 100 percent connected. The obtained connectivity score through our algorithm will help the agency to identify the appropriate portion of the network where improvement is required.
